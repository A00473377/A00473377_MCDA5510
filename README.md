Hi,
I am Zaid Shaikh from Mumbai, India. I have completed my bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication domain, and I have been working in Deloitte as a Consultant under Salesforce Development technology. Been with Deloitte for 2.5 years and learned various skils during my tenure here.

For this activity we started talking about movies and then suddenly we came with the common topic of stand up comedy. We donâ€™t know what made the conversation among the three us so interesting that we ended up discussing for 20 minutes. I love watching stand up comedy as well as quoting some of the best lines performed by artists. Then we started talking about individual artists and our favourite ones. Then we shared some of our saved and go to stand up specials that made me realize there are still a lot of stand up comics I need to explore. And though I am yet to see the ones we discussed that day, I am already looking forward to complete those and recommending the same to these guys.

Regarding the course, I am quite excited to learn about software development aspects, though i have worked as a developer, learning the concepts makes it interesting. Other than development, I am curious about the data analytics part of the course and am looking forward to explore that domain as well.
