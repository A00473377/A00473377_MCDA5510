For this activity we started talking about movies and then suddenly we came with the common topic of stand up comedy. We donâ€™t know what made the conversation among the three us so interesting that we ended up discussing for 20 minutes. I love watching stand up comedy as well as quoting some of the best lines performed by artists. Then we started talking about individual artists and our favourite ones. Then we shared some of our saved and go to stand up specials that made me realize there are still a lot of stand up comics I need to explore. And though I am yet to see the ones we discussed that day, I am already looking forward to complete those and recommending the same to these guys.

//Intro of the group members: Neeyati and Hrithik
My group members are:
Neeyati: Hritik, Zaid and I teamed up for this assignment. Belonging to the same country, it was easier to find things in common. At first, we chatted about our movie tastes and our favourite ways to kill time. Funnily enough, all of us watch stand-up comedy a lot. We dived into discussing our beloved comedians and even swapped recommendations for the funniest stand-up bits. Somehow, our conversation diverted towards food, and we also realised that we share a liking for spicy food and decided to visit some of the local Indian restaurant together sometime soon. It is safe to say this assignment has turned into a fantastic bonding experience. Apart from my interest in CS, I enjoy cooking and baking. I am not a professional painter, but I paint sometimes too to relax. Usually, over the weekends, I watch a movie or two.

Hrithik: I like to play game and exploring new cuisines. I opted for this course due to its smaller class sizes, which allow for a more personalised learning experience and The inclusion of a co-op program was the icing on the cake, making it an ideal choice for me.

Regarding the course, I am quite excited to learn about software development aspects, though i have worked as a developer, learning the concepts makes it interesting. Other than development, I am curious about the data analytics part of the course and am looking forward to explore that domain as well.
